## CI/CD Pipeline processing

Description 
* Create automation for building a deploying process,improve efficiency, and reduce errors

Goals
* Automate the build and deployment process
* Reduce errors and improve efficiency
* Facilitate collaboration among team members
* Usage of Google Analytics and Passing the GDPR Regulation

User Stories
* As a user, the pipeline should be set up to trigger automatically whenever changes are made to the code repository
* As a user, the pipeline should be set up to notify the team of any failures or errors during the build or deployment process

Dependencies
* Availability of the tech stack being used
* Availability of the selected CI/CD tool
* Availability of teamwork

Risks
* Integration issues with the tech stack and the CI/CD tool
* Technical issues during the setup process
* Lack of familiarity with the selected CI/CD tool

Estimated Effort
* 2-4 weeks depending on team size and experience

Business Value
* Increased efficiency, improved quality, greater Agility, enhanced security for users

Priority
* Automation

## Test Plan
* Integration tests - To validate the interaction between different components of the pipeline, such as the build and deployment processes. For example, integration tests can be created to verify that the updated code is being built correctly and deployed to the designated environment.
* Compliance Testing - Software testing that involves testing a software application or system to ensure that it complies with specific regulations, standards, or requirements.

## Measuring Effectiveness
* Change failure rate - This KPI measures the percentage of code changes that result in issues or failures in production. A low change failure rate indicates that the DevOps process is effective in ensuring code quality and reducing the risk of issues in production.
