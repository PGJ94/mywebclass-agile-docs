# Initiative 1: DevOps
Description
* Software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between development and operations teams to improve the speed and quality of delivering software

Goals
* To improve the speed and efficiency of delivering software.
* To increasing collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.
* To enhance the quality and reliability of software products.
* To automate the software development process wherever possible
* Usage of Google Analytics and Passing the GDPR Regulation

Scope
* Integrating tools and technologies to support the DevOps process
* Establishing standard for collaboration, communication, and automation.
* Meeting regulations

Outcomes
* Software delivery improvement
* Enhanced collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.
* Higher quality and reliability of software products.

Deliverables
* A DevOps culture plan
* An integrated toolchain that aids continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.
* Standard operating procedures for the DevOps process that best suits this process.
* Automated software development pipeline.

Milestones
* Implementing the toolchain and integrating it with the system.
* Creating and implementing best practices and standard operating procedures.
* Automating software development process.

Constraints
* Budget
* Limited time

Assumptions
* Resources will be available within timeline.
* Learn and implement DevOps tools and processes.

Risks
* Automated test fail
* Integration issues with existing systems and tools.

Dependencies
* Availability of necessary tools and technologies.
* Cooperation and collaboration of all teams involved in the development process.

Team
* DevOps engineer 
* Software development manager 
* QA engineer

## Test Plan
* Unit Tests - These tests are used to test individual code modules or functions in isolation, without any external dependencies. They help to catch any defects early on in the development process and ensure that code behaves as expected.
* Compliance Testing - Software testing that involves testing a software application or system to ensure that it complies with specific regulations, standards, or requirements.

## Measuring Effectiveness
* Deployment Frequency - This KPI measures how frequently new code changes are deployed to production. A high deployment frequency indicates that the DevOps process is efficient in delivering new features and bug fixes to the website.
