# Initiative 1: DevOps
Description
* Software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between development and operations teams to improve the speed and quality of delivering software

Goals
* To improve the speed and efficiency of delivering software.
* To increasing collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.
* To enhance the quality and reliability of software products.
* To automate the software development process wherever possible

Scope
* Integrating tools and technologies to support the DevOps process
* Establishing standard for collaboration, communication, and automation.

Outcomes
* Software delivery improvement
* Enhanced collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.
* Higher quality and reliability of software products.

Deliverables
* A DevOps culture plan
* An integrated toolchain that aids continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.
* Standard operating procedures for the DevOps process that best suits this process.
* Automated software development pipeline.

Milestones
* Implementing the toolchain and integrating it with the system.
* Creating and implementing best practices and standard operating procedures.
* Automating software development process.

Constraints
* Budget
* Limited time

Assumptions
* Resources will be available within timeline.
* Learn and implement DevOps tools and processes.

Risks
* Automated test fail
* Integration issues with existing systems and tools.

Dependencies
* Availability of necessary tools and technologies.
* Cooperation and collaboration of all teams involved in the development process.

Team
* DevOps engineer 
* Software development manager 
* QA engineer

## Test Plan
* Integration Testing - is an important step in the software development process as it helps to identify defects early on, which can be more difficult and expensive to fix later in the development cycle. It also helps to ensure that the overall system behaves as expected and meets the requirements and specifications of the stakeholders.
* Compliance Testing - software testing that involves testing a software application or system to ensure that it complies with specific regulations, standards, or requirements.

## Measuring Effectiveness
* Traffic and Engagement - Measures the amount of traffic and engagement the website receives. By using Google Analytics, the development team can track the website's performance and make adjustments to increase traffic and engagement.
