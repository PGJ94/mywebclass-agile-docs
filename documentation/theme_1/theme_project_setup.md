I updated the above links to work, they did not work for me. When the file you are linking to is in the same folder as where linking from, you don't need a path.
It might also make more sense to have sub folders for initiatives, epics, stories, etc. 

## Test Plan
* Functional Testing - This involves testing the website's functionality as a whole, including testing user interactions and the user interface. This can be done manually or through automated testing tools
* Compliance Testing - Software testing that involves testing a software application or system to ensure that it complies with specific regulations, standards, or requirements.

## Measuring Effectiveness
* Traffic and Engagement - Measures the amount of traffic and engagement the website receives. By using Google Analytics, the development team can track the website's performance and make adjustments to increase traffic and engagement.
