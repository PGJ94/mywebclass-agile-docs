"As a user, the pipeline should be set up to trigger automatically whenever changes are made to the code repository"

Acceptance Criteria:

Given that the pipeline is set up for the website,
When changes are made to the code repository,
Then the pipeline should automatically trigger,
And the pipeline should run all relevant tests and build processes,
And the pipeline should deploy the updated code to the designated environment if all tests and builds are successful,
And the pipeline should notify the relevant stakeholders if any errors or issues occur during the pipeline process.

## Test Plan
* End-to-end Tests - These tests can be used to validate the entire pipeline process from start to finish, including the monitoring of the code repository, triggering of the pipeline, running of tests and builds, and deployment of the updated code. For example, end-to-end tests can be created to verify that the pipeline is functioning as expected and that the updated code is being deployed to the correct environment.
* Compliance Testing - Software testing that involves testing a software application or system to ensure that it complies with specific regulations, standards, or requirements.

## Measuring Effectiveness
* Pipeline success rate - Measures the percentage of times the pipeline successfully triggers and deploys the updated code to the designated environment. A high success rate indicates that the pipeline is functioning effectively, while a low success rate may indicate issues with the pipeline setup or configuration.
