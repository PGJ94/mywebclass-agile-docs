## Test Plan
* Performance Testing - Conduct load testing and measure response time, throughput, and resource utilization to ensure the website loads quickly and smoothly even during peak traffic
* Compliance Testing - Software testing that involves testing a software application or system to ensure that it complies with specific regulations, standards, or requirements

## Measuring Effectiveness
* Page Load Time - The time it takes for the page to load completely. This metric can be measured using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix, and Pingdom.
