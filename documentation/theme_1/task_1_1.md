Task Title
* Set up pipeline to trigger on code repository changes

User Story
* As a user, the pipeline should be set up to trigger automatically whenever changes are made to the code repository

Description
* This task involves setting up a pipeline that automatically triggers when changes are made to the code repository. 
* The pipeline should include automated tests to verify the functionality and performance of the updated code, as well as the deployment process. 
* The Acceptance Criteria:
  * The pipeline should be triggered automatically when changes are made to the code repository 
  * Automated tests should be included in the pipeline to verify the functionality and performance of the updated code and the deployment process 
  * The updated code should be deployed to the designated environment automatically after passing all tests 
  * The pipeline should send notifications to stakeholders when changes are made and when the deployment process is complete 
  * The pipeline should be well-documented and easy to maintain
* Dependencies:
  *  Access to the code repository and the designated deployment environment.

## Test Plan
* End-to-end Tests - These tests can be used to validate the entire pipeline process from start to finish, including the monitoring of the code repository, triggering of the pipeline, running of tests and builds, and deployment of the updated code. For example, end-to-end tests can be created to verify that the pipeline is functioning as expected and that the updated code is being deployed to the correct environment.
* Compliance Testing - Software testing that involves testing a software application or system to ensure that it complies with specific regulations, standards, or requirements.

## Measuring Effectiveness
* Pipeline Trigger Time - Measure the time it takes for the pipeline to trigger after changes are made to the code repository. This metric can be used to ensure that the pipeline is triggered in a timely manner and that there are no delays in the build and deployment process.
