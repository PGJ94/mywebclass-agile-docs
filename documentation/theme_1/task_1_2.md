Task Title
* Set up pipeline notifications for build and deployment failures

User Story
* "As a user, the pipeline should be set up to notify the team of any failures or errors during the build or deployment process"

Description
* Configure the pipeline to send notifications to the team whenever there are build or deployment failures.
* Identify the appropriate notification channels and ensure they are set up correctly.
* Define the notification message content, including error details, build or deployment stage, and any remediation steps required.
* Test the notification process to ensure it works as expected.
* Define a process for handling notifications, including response times and escalation procedures.
* Acceptance Criteria:
  * The pipeline is configured to send notifications to the team whenever there are build or deployment failures.
  * Notifications are sent to the appropriate notification channels (e.g., email, Slack, or PagerDuty) and contain all the necessary information, including error details, build or deployment stage, and any remediation steps required.
  * The notification process is tested and works as expected.
  * A process for handling notifications is defined, including response times and escalation procedures.
* Dependencies:
  * The pipeline must be set up with appropriate monitoring and logging capabilities to identify build and deployment failures.

## Test Plan
* Regression Test - Verify that the notification message contains all the necessary information, including error details, build or deployment stage, and any remediation steps required.
* Compliance Testing - Software testing that involves testing a software application or system to ensure that it complies with specific regulations, standards, or requirements.

## Measuring Effectiveness
* Notification Delivery Rate - Measure the percentage of notifications that are successfully delivered to team members. This metric can be used to ensure that notifications are being sent to the correct channels and that team members are receiving them.
